                Wellcome to the Basic Car Documentation web, here you will see some parts that are important for your vehicle, know about them will make you be better prepared for the issues that maybe comming in the future.

        <section class="main-section" id="radiator">
            <header>Radiator</header>
            <p class="description">
                The radiator is a heat exchanger used to remove heat from the coolant in the cooling system to prevent your vehicle's engine from overheating. Hot coolant is routed through the radiator, where the coolant can exchange heat with the passing air.
                For general maintenance on your radiator, check your coolant levels twice a year. Replacing a radiator can take most of the day, but is a doable DIY job.

        <section class="main-section" id="ac_compressor">
            <header>AC Compressor</header>
            <p class="description">
                The compressor is the power unit of the air-conditioning system that puts the refrigerant under high pressure before it pumps it into the condenser, where it changes from a gas to a liquid. A fully functioning compressor is necessary for the air-conditioning system to provide peak performance.

            <header>Battery</header>
            <p class="description">
                An automobile battery is an example of a wet cell battery, with six cells. Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates made of a lead alloy grid filled with sponge lead (cathode plates) or coated with lead dioxide (anode). Each cell is filled with a sulfuric acid solution, which is the electrolyte. Other terms you may run into when talking about a car battery are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Battery Terminal:</span> A means of connecting the battery to the vehicle's electrical system. The three types of battery terminals are post or top, side, and L.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Battery Capacity:</span> The energy output of a battery measured in amp/hours.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Cold Cranking Amps:</span> Abbreviated CCA, this refers to the amount of current that the battery can supply to the vehicle.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Group Size:</span> The group size is just what it sounds like, the size of the battery.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="alternator">
            <header>Alternator</header>
            <p class="description">
                The alternator is a generator that produces electricity to power the car’s ignition system, lights and accessories. The engine drives the alternator by means of a belt, either with a dedicated belt or a belt shared with other pulley-driven components. An alternator will stop immediately if its drive belt breaks, but alternators can also fail over time and with use, requiring replacement. Failing alternators can result in repeatedly drained batteries, dimming headlights and localized noise.

            <header>Brakes</header>
            <p class="description">
                A car's brake system is used to stop or slow a vehicle and/or prevent it from moving when stopped or parked. The two most common systems are disc brakes and drum brake systems. Some of the most common disc brake parts include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Caliper:</span> Non-rotational components of disc brakes that straddle the disc and contain hydraulic components forcing the brake pads against the rotor to slow or stop the vehicle. Can be found in the front or rear of a vehicle.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Brake Pad:</span> The pad of friction material that is pressed against the disc by the caliper, to slow or stop a vehicle. It is also a term often used for brake lining.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Brake Rotor:</span> Disc-shaped component that revolves with hub and wheel. The lining pads are forced against the rotor to provide a friction surface for the brake system, to slow or stop a vehicle.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="catalytic_converter">
            <header>Catalytic converter</header>
            <p class="description">
                The catalytic converter is an automotive exhaust-system component, made of stainless steel, containing a catalyst to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and/or hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO), in tailpipe emissions. It is used to remove pollutants and make exhaust gasses less harmful to the environment.

        <section class="main-section" id="transmission">
            <header>Transmission</header>
            <p class="description">
                The transmission is a gearing device of a vehicle that provides variable ratios between the engine output and the differential input. Automotive transmissions are more complex than bicycle transmissions, but they play the same basic function, allowing the driver (or engine computer) to select smaller or larger gears to optimize driving conditions without working the engine too hard.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Automatic Transmission:</span> A transmission in which gear ratios are changed automatically using automatic transmission fluid (ATF). Shifts are controlled by the engine computer.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Manual Transmission:</span> A manually shifted gearing device in the power train that allows variation on the relationship between engine speed and road speed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="engine">
            <header>Engine</header>
            <p class="description">
                The purpose of a gasoline car engine is to convert gasoline into motion so that your car can move. Currently the easiest way to create motion from gasoline is to burn the gasoline inside an engine. Therefore, a car engine is an internal combustion engine — combustion takes place internally.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="muffler">
            <header>Muffler</header>
            <p class="description">
                The muffler comes just before the end of the exhaust pipe and is responsible for reducing the noise emitted by the exhaust system. It restricts exhaust gas flow, which leads to a quieter ride. Some mufflers restrict gas flow more or less, which results in quieter or louder exhaust noise respectively.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="shock_absorbers">
            <header>Shockd absorbers</header>
            <p class="description">
                Shock absorbers are a hydraulic device used at each wheel of the suspension system to help control the up, down, and rolling motion of a car body by dampening the oscillations or jounce of the springs when the car goes over bumps, thereby contributing to vehicle safety and passenger comfort. Also referred to as a shock or strut, depending on which the vehicle is equipped with.
